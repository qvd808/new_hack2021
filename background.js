// create a dictionary, save to chrome local storage

// check which website the user is on every second

// if the user is on a new website, add that website to the dictionary
// make sure only the first part of the URL is saved. 

// if the user is on a website they already visited, add time to that website 

// create a variable called firstTime on chrome local storage to keep track of the first time they open their active tab

// then, after the user switches tabs, it will do the currentTime - firstTime, and add that time to the dictionary
